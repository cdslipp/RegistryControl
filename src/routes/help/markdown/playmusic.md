# How to Play Music with the AUX Cord
Wanna play music on our system? Here's what you need to do:

## Turning on the Sound System
To get the music playing, you first need to power up the sound system:

1. **Turn on the Furman Power Conditioner:** Located at the top of the rack to the left of the sound board.
2. **Power Up the Subwoofer:** Head onstage towards stage left and turn on the yellow Mastercraft powerbar above the subwoofer.

## Connecting Your Device

While a laptop is recommended for optimal audio quality, you can also use your phone. Follow these steps to connect:

1. **Connect to Stereo 2:** Plug your device into the adapter connected to Stereo 2.
2. **Unmute and Adjust Stereo 2 Channel:** Ensure that the Stereo 2 channel is unmuted (the red light should be off) and the fader is up.
3. **Check Channel Assignment:** The Stereo 2 channel should be assigned to L/R and M.
4. **Unmute and Adjust Master Faders:** Make sure the red L/R and M faders towards the centre/right of the board are unmuted. Then, slowly push them up to your desired volume.

_Remember to download your music files in advance for uninterrupted playback._

**Happy listening!**

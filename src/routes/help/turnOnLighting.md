# How to Turn On the Lighting Board

Operating the ETC Element Classic Lighting Console.

## Getting Started

1. **Remove the Lighting Board Cover:** Carefully take off the cover from the lighting board. Remember to replace it after you're done.
2. **Power Up the Console:** Press the power button located on the top right-hand side of the lighting board.
3. **Wait for Boot-Up:** Give the board some time to boot. This process may take a few moments.

## Operating the Board

Once the board has booted:

- **Adjust the Faders:** You can now move the labeled faders on the left portion of the board and observe the changes onstage.

## Controlling House Lights

To gain control over the house lights:

1. **Use the Rightmost Fader:** Push up the farthest fader to the right in the bottom row of faders.
2. **Switch the House Lights to "Dim":** Go to the house lights switch in the VOM (Voice of the Monarch) and switch it to "dim". This allows the lighting console to control the house lights.

With these simple steps, you'll be able to effectively manage the lighting for your theater's productions.

**Illuminate your performance with ease!**
